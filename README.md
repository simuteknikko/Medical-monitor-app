## About Me

My name is **Henry Alatyppö**, and I work as a **Simulation Technician** at Helsinki University Hospital.

I started this project to provide a **free, simple, and accessible patient monitor simulation tool**. In my work, I have noticed that some large companies offer expensive enterprise solutions, but the features they provide are not always worth the cost. This project is my response to that gap.

You can run the monitor application at **https://medicalmonitorsim.com**.  
The app is **completely free**, and I intend to keep it that way.  
It is released under the **GPL 3.0 license**.

## Monitor Modes

The monitor supports two operating modes: **Standalone** and **Multi‑Device**.

### Standalone Mode
In standalone mode, the **monitor display and controller** are opened on the same page.  
You can adjust values using the controller and activate the monitor. When changes are made, simply press **“Update Vitals Monitor”**, and the monitor display will update accordingly. This mode is ideal for quick testing and single‑device use.

### Multi‑Device Mode
Multi‑device mode is designed to **eliminate the need for dedicated or proprietary hardware**.  
The application runs on **any device with a modern web browser**, allowing you to use existing hardware instead of purchasing separate controllers or displays.

For example, you can display the monitor on a laptop, tablet, or external screen, while controlling it from a smartphone or another computer. This makes the system flexible, cost‑effective, and easy to integrate into different simulation setups without additional equipment.
